# [Login] Account Login Problems

- The map client uses a <span style="color: red">Gitee account</span>, <span style="color: red">not your game account</span>
- You can register a Gitee account if you don't have one

---

- The client is <span style="color: red">unable to log you in</span> using a <span style="color: red">phone number</span>, please use your <span style="color: ">linked Email</span> or <span style="color: red">Gitee username</span> to log in

(You can find your username under your Gitee profile, excluding "@")

---

If you are still unable to log in, please visit [Gitee](https://gitee.com/), and attempt to log in using your linked Email or username.
If you cannot log into Gitee properly, please double check if the username or password is correct
If you can log into Gitee properly, while not able to do so in the client, please refer to Known Issue below, and change your password to a mix of numbers and letters only.

### Known Issues

- Some special characters in the username or password will prevent log in (e.g. "&", "+", "-")
- Please change your password if it includes special characters, and use Email to log in when your username includes special characters.
- Special characters in passwords will prevent the client from saving your password, thus it will request login on each launch
- If login issue persist even when neither of your username or password includes special characters, it may be caused by a delay in Gitee's thrid party login API, please wait for serveral hours after registration and attemp again
